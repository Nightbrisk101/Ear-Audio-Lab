# Ear-Audio-Lab
Have the ability to EQ all audio files to a distorted range automatically, and you edit how distorted it can be with this tool. Please reduce system volume levels before playback. Processed audio files may contain significantly elevated amplitude levels that could cause discomfort or equipment damage at standard listening volumes.
